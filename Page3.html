			<h2>Our Supercluster</h2>
			<p>About three-quarters of all galaxies are clustered, with many small groups of galaxies located nearby. The Virgo Cluster, a giant 2000-galaxy cluster, is about 65 million light years away. Nearby small groups form an enormous flattened cluster called the Local Supercluster, which is centered on the Virgo Cluster and has a collective mass of about 1015 times the Sun's mass.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The closest galaxy cluster to ours is the M81 group, located 104,060,000,000,000,000,000 km (11 million light years or 3.3 Mpc). Other objects used as standard candles include novae, HII regions, globular clusters, supernovae, and entire galaxies. These objects allow us to find distances to more distant objects.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Relationships like the Tully-Fisher relation, which says that the rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy is correlated with the total luminosity of the galaxy, are often called secondary distance indicators. They are useful in measuring relative distances to galaxies but not very useful in pinning down absolute values. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is one of HST's key projects to observe Cepheid variables in ~20 nearby galaxies and calibrate the secondary distance indicators.</p>
			<br>
			<p>These distances are important to astronomers because they influence the velocities of each other, such as the Andromeda Galaxy approaching towards the Milky Way. To establish the Hubble constant, it is necessary to measure the velocities and distances to galaxies at the edge of the Local Supercluster and beyond.</p>
