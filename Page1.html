				<h2>Our Home, The Earth</h2>
				<p>Earth, the fifth largest planet in our solar system, has a hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant. Its vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago. Earth's equatorial diameter is 7926 miles, and it orbits the Sun every 23.9 hours, taking 365.25 days to complete one trip around the Sun. To keep our calendar system consistent, we add one day every four years, known as a leap day or leap year. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees, causing our yearly cycle of seasons. The Moon, the brightest and most familiar object in the night sky, stabilizes Earth's wobble and makes the climate less variable over thousands of years. Earth sometimes hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks, which are trapped by Earth's gravity for a few months or years before returning to an orbit around the Sun.</p>

				<h2>Our Solar System</h2>
				<p>The solar system, located in the Orion Spur of the Milky Way, consists of the Sun, eight planets, five dwarf planets, hundreds of moons, and thousands of asteroids and comets. The name "solar" is derived from the Latin word for Sun, "solis." Our solar system extends beyond the planets that orbit the Sun, including the Kuiper Belt, which lies past Neptune's orbit. Beyond the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud, a giant spherical shell surrounding our solar system. This shell is made of icy debris orbiting our Sun as far as 1.6 light-years away and is thick, extending from 5,000 to 100,000 astronomical units.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The Sun's heliosphere, created by the solar wind, doesn't extend as far, but it is the boundary where orbiting objects can turn around and return closer to our Sun. NASA spacecraft Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have crossed the termination shock, crossing the edge between 80-100 astronomical units.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Our solar system has hundreds of moons orbiting planets, dwarf planets, and asteroids. Mercury and Venus have no moons, but Venus does have a quasi-satellite named Zoozve. Jupiter and Saturn lead our solar system's moon counts, with Pluto having five moons in its orbit, including Charon, a moon so large it makes Pluto wobble.</p>
