			<h2>Our Galaxy</h2>
			<p>Galaxies are composed of stars, planets, and vast clouds of gas and dust bound together by gravity. They come in various shapes, including spirals, ellipticals, and irregular ones. Most galaxies are between 10 billion and 13.6 billion years old, with some as old as the universe itself. They can organize into groups of 100 or fewer members, larger clusters, or superclusters. The cosmic web of matter in the universe includes superclusters, empty voids, and "walls" of galaxies. Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, is a spiral galaxy with a disk of stars spanning over 100,000 light-years. It takes about 240 million years for our solar system to orbit the Milky Way. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which includes over 50 other galaxies ranging in size from dwarf galaxies to Andromeda. The Local Group is located off the edge of the Virgo cluster and is part of the Laniakea supercluster.</p>
