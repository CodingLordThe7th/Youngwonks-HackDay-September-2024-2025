			<h2>Our Observable Universe</h2>
			<p>The universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old, determined by measuring the ages of the oldest stars and the rate of expansion. The Doppler shift in light from galaxies indicates that they are moving away from us and each other faster than expected. This suggests that the universe was more compact in the past than it is today. Scientists have found that before galaxies formed or stars began fusing hydrogen into helium, things were so close together and hot that atoms couldn't form and photons had nowhere to go. The universe is made up of all energy and matter, with much of it taking the form of individual atoms of hydrogen. Humans categorize clumps of matter based on their attributes, such as galaxies, star clusters, planets, and comets.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Scientists have begun to estimate the number of stars and galaxies in the universe, which is at least 100 billion. However, the universe also contains dark matter and dark energy, which are not directly observed. About 27% of the universe is dark matter, and 68% is dark energy. This is because dark matter and dark energy are not directly observed. Human understanding of the universe has evolved over time, with myths and scientific tools providing hints about its nature. Only a few hundred years ago, the term "scientist" was not even used. Over the past century, space probes have been sent to the outer solar system, Mars, and Earth, and the first large space telescopes have provided breathtaking views of the cosmos. In the early 21st century, astronomers discovered thousands of planets, detected gravitational waves, and produced the first image of a black hole. Despite advancements in technology and imagination, most of the universe remains unknown.</p>
